# 📝 ToDo List

This is a **simple ToDo List project** I made to practice my skills with **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. The idea is to keep improving it over time by adding new features and making it more complete.

## 💭 Why Vanilla JS?

Lately, I’ve been putting a lot of value on learning and practicing **vanilla JavaScript**, because it’s the foundation of everything. All the popular frameworks (like React, Vue, Angular) depend on it under the hood.  
Unfortunately, many people overlook it — but it’s incredibly important and powerful when mastered.
